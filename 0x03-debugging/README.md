# Debugging

Project done during **FullStack Software Engineering studies** at **[Alx Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/)**. It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 9.4.0`
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS
gcc (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1) 9.4.0

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-main.c` | Test that function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0` |
| `1-main.c` | Fixed program to the infinite loop |
| `2-largest_number.c` | Prints the largest of three integers |
| `3-print_remaining_days.c` | Converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year |
| `main.h` | Header file |
